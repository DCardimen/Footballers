# RUNNING IT BACK — Life of a Player

A football career-simulation game (Phaser + canvas). The live game is
**GRIDIRON v15.21**.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build -> dist/
npm run shot     # screenshot the running game (headless) for quick validation
```

The whole game ships as a single self-contained `index.html` (baked sprite
atlas + field art as data URLs, Phaser bundled inline). The readable systems
worth knowing about live in these inline `<script>` blocks:

- **Play choreography engine** — `buildPlayScript(payload, cfg)` builds every
  actor's keyframes, the ball flight, and the event stream for a play. Pure, no
  Phaser/DOM. This is where running, contact, tackling and gang-tackle logic live.
- **`LiveField` Phaser scene** — plays the script back: projects sim coords to
  the north-south broadcast view (`PJ`), drives sprite facing/animation
  (`placeMarker` / `faceMarker`), and turns events into on-field FX (`fireEvent`).
- **`rib-v1520-phaser-runtime`** — per-player appearance/sizing and the football.

Every gameplay dial reads through `TU(key, default)`, so values can be retuned
live via `window.RIB_TUNE[key] = ...` without touching code.

## Recent changes

- **Player gear overlay removed (temporarily).** A vector "appearance" layer used
  to draw a second procedural player (helmet shell, facemask, visor, sleeves,
  gloves, neck roll, back plate, towel, knee pads, high socks, …) on top of the
  baked pixel-art sprite, which read as cluttered. It is now disabled — the clean
  baked sprites stand on their own.
  - **To re-enable:** set `GEAR_OVERLAY_ENABLED = true` at the top of the
    `rib-v1520-phaser-runtime` script. All the machinery (traits, front/rear
    groups, per-frame flipping) is still present and untouched; consider trimming
    `traitsFor()` / `__RIB20_applyAppearance()` to just the accessories you want
    before turning it back on so it complements the sprite instead of doubling it.
    Per-position body sizing is not gear and stays on either way.
- **Field art un-mirrored.** The baked field texture is stored horizontally
  flipped (TOUCHDOWN/END ZONE and every yard number read backwards); it is now
  drawn with `setFlipX(true)` so text and numbers read correctly. The turf is
  left/right symmetric, so hash marks and yard lines stay aligned to play.
- **Running directions** verified against the fixed field: the offense always
  attacks the top of the screen (rear-facing sprites), the defense faces down,
  and sprite facing tracks screen-space motion via `faceMarker`.
- **Tackle motion + whiff.** The closing defender now commits a diving/wrapping
  tackle attempt (`tackleLunge` → `tackleHit` or `tackleWhiff`). He can whiff on a
  shifty, full-speed back — but committing is what brings runners down: a landed
  lunge wraps early, and even a whiff staggers the carrier so support cleans up
  (attempting a tackle increases the odds of a stop).
  - Tunables: `lungeReach`, `supportReach`, `whiffMs`, `staggerMs`.
- **Multi-tackler speed / pull-down.** More hands on a full-speed carrier kill his
  speed faster: two men drop it fast, three collapse it. Three tacklers wrestle a
  runner down in ~1s, two take longer, and a **clearly stronger** carrier drags the
  pile for extra time before going down.
  - Tunables: `gangMismatch`, `pull2Ms`, `pull3Ms`, `pileFloor`, `contactSlow`.

The provided `TACKLE` / `RUNNING GRAB` / `CATCH` sprite sheets are reference art
for these animations; the runtime currently animates the vector/baked sprites
rather than blitting the sheets directly. A drop-in loader for a 3×11 sheet
already exists: `window.__GRIDIRON_LOAD_SHEET(srcOrDataURL, "off"|"def"|"you")`.
